# Tutorial

For this tutorial, we're going to be fuzzing the URL parsing crate [rust-url][]. Our goal here is to find some input generated by the fuzzer such that, when passed to `Url::parse`, it causes some sort of panic or crash to happen.

To start, clone the rust-url repository and change directories into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/servo/rust-url.git
cd rust-url
```

Although we could fuzz the latest commit on `master`, we're going to checkout a specific revision that is known to have a parsing bug:

```sh
git checkout bfa167b4e0253642b6766a7aa74a99df60a94048
```

Initialize cargo-fuzz:

```sh
cargo fuzz init
```

This will create a directory called `fuzz_targets` which will contain a collection of *fuzzing targets*. It is generally a good idea to check in the files generated by `init`. Each fuzz target is a Rust program that is given random data and tests a crate (in this case, rust-url). `cargo fuzz init` automatically generates an initial fuzz target for us.
Use `cargo fuzz list` to view the list of all existing fuzz targets:

```sh
cargo fuzz list
```

The source code for this fuzz target by default lives in `fuzz/fuzz_targets/<fuzz target name>.rs`. Open that file and edit it to look like this:

```rust,ignore
#![no_main]
#[macro_use] extern crate libfuzzer_sys;
extern crate url;

fuzz_target!(|data: &[u8]| {
    if let Ok(s) = std::str::from_utf8(data) {
        let _ = url::Url::parse(s);
    }
});
```

`libFuzzer` is going to repeatedly call the body of `fuzz_target!()` with a slice of pseudo-random bytes, until your program hits an error condition (segfault, panic, etc). Write your `fuzz_target!()` body to hit the entry point you need.

Since the generated data is a byte slice, we'll need to convert it to a UTF-8 `&str` since rust-url expects that when parsing.

To begin fuzzing, run:

```sh
cargo fuzz run <fuzz target name>
```

Congratulations, you're fuzzing! The output you're seeing is generated by the fuzzer [libFuzzer]. To learn more about what the output means [see the 'output' section in the libFuzzer documentation][libFuzzer output].

If you leave it going for long enough you'll eventually discover a crash. The output would look something like this:
